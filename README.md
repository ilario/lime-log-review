Collection of lognorm rules to process the logs sent from the libremesh nodes to a rsyslog server.
This will be very useful to process and debug the diferent states the device is, and also catch any
unexpected situation.

# TODO

  * Run rules in the node instead of in the log server
  * React to situations detected in the logs locally
  * Notify the user about the situations
